    <strong>Tim Berners - Lee(8 June 1955)</strong>
  </p>
</center>
  <p>
    In 1980,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist">physicist Tim Berners-Lee
    </a>, a contractor at <a herf="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">CERN
    </a>proposed and prototyped<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENQUIRE">ENQUIRE
    </a>a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an I
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"></a>based 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">system</a>.Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_system">data system</a>engieer
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau">Robert Cailliau</a>
    collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedi">Encclopedi</a> is the first entry.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN_SGML">CERN SGML</a>, an in-house 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language">Standard  Generalized Markup Language</a>
    (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    HTMLis a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">Markup language</a>That
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">Web browser</a> use to interpret and 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting">compose</a>text, images, and other material into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a>Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TYPSET_and_RUNOFF">RUNOFF command</a>developed in the early 1960s for the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatible_Time-Sharing_System">CTSS</a>(Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.

  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Connolly_(computer_scientist)">Dan Connolly</a>, which included an SGML 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_definition"Document type definition ></a>to define the syntax. The draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSA_Mosaic" >NCSA Mosaic</a>
     browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly,
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Raggett"> Dave Raggett's</a>
      competing Internet Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.

  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group. In 1995, this working group completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium"> World Wide Web Consortium </a>
     (W3C).[14] In 2000, HTML became an international standard (
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization">ISO</a>
      /
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Electrotechnical_Commission">IEC </a>
       15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004, development began on HTML5 in the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHATWG">Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group</a> 
        (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and was completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.

Initially code-named "Wilbur", HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape"> Netscape</a>'s Netsc visual markup tags. Netscape'

   <br>
<li>Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed.</li>
</strong>
<p>
  Initially code-named "Cougar", HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, but also sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecation">deprecated</a> in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO 8879-SGML.

    for HTML 3 and Cascading Style Sheets, but HTML 3.0 did not succeed for several reasons. The draft was considered very large at 150 pages and the pace of browser development, as well as the number of interested parties, had outstripped the resources of the IETF. Browser vendors, including Microsoft and Netscape at the time, chose to implement different subsets of HTML 3's draft features as well as to introduce their own extensions to it. (see
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars" >browser wars</a>.) These included extensions to control stylistic aspects of documents, contrary to the "belief [of the academic engineering community] that such things as text color, background texture, font size, and font face were definitely outside the scope of a language when their only intent was to specify how a document would be organized." Dave Raggett, who has been a W3C Fellow for many years, has commented for example: "To a certain extent, Microsoft built its business on the Web by extending HTML features."</dd>

  <h3>2011 HTML5 - Last Call</h3>
  <dd>On 14 February 2011, the W3C extended the charter of its HTML Working Group with clear milestones for HTML5. In May 2011, the working group advanced HTML5 to "Last Call", an invitation to communities inside and outside W3C to confirm the technical soundness of the specification. The W3C developed a comprehensive test suite to achieve broad interoperability for the full specification by 2014, which was the target date for recommendation. In January 2011, the WHATWG renamed its "HTML5" living standard to "HTML". The W3C nevertheless continued its project to release HTML5.</dd>

     will continue the HTML5 specification work, focusing on a single definitive standard, which is considered a "snapshot" by WHATWG. The WHATWG organization will continue its work with HTML5 as a "Living Standard". The concept of a living standard is that it is never complete and is always being updated and improved. New features can be added but functionality will not be removed.</dd> 
     <dd>In December 2012, W3C designated HTML5 as a Candidate Recommendation.[54] The criterion for advancement to
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium#W3C_recommendation_(REC)"> W3C Recommendation</a>
       is "two 100% complete and fully interoperable implementations"</dd>

    <p>On 28 May 2019, the W3C announced that WHATWG would be the sole publisher of the HTML and DOM standards. The W3C and WHATWG had been publishing competing standards since 2012. While the W3C standard was identical to the WHATWG in 2007 the standards have since progressively diverged due to different design decisions. The WHATWG "Living Standard" had been the de facto web standard for some time.</p>

    <h2>Markup</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references.
       HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like  and , although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example .
       The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</p>
    <p>Another important component is the HTML
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page"> document type declaration</a>
      , which triggers
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode" >standards mode rendering.</a></p>

      <p>HTML documents imply a structure of nested 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element">HTML elements</a>. 
      These are indicated in the document by HTML tags, enclosed in angle brackets.</p>
      
      <p>In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a "start tag" p and "end tag" p. The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.</p>
      
    
    <p>Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of tags and text. This indicates further (nested) elements, as children of the parent element.</p>
    
    <p>The start tag may also include the element's attributes within the tag. These indicate other information, such as identifiers for sections within the document, identifiers used to bind style information to the presentation of the document, and for some tags such as the  used to embed images, the reference to the image resource in the format like this:</p>
    
    <p>Some elements, such as the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline">line break  </a> do not permit any embedded content, either text or further tags. These require only a single empty tag (akin to a start tag) and do not use an end tag.</p>
      
  <p>Many tags, particularly the closing end tag for the very commonly used paragraph element  are optional. An HTML browser or other agent can infer the closure for the end of an element from the context and the structural rules defined by the HTML standard. These rules are complex and not widely understood by most HTML authors.</p>

<p>
The general form of an HTML element is therefore: tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2"''content''tag. Some HTML elements are defined as empty elements and take the form tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2". Empty elements may enclose no content, for instance, the tag or the inline image tag. The name of an HTML element is the name used in the tags. The end tag's name is preceded by a slash character /. If a tag has no content, an end tag is not allowed. If attributes are not mentioned, default values are used in each case.

  <h3>Heading</h3>
  <p>HTML headings are defined with the   &lttags h1&gttags to &lttags h6 &gt with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least:</p>
  <div> &lttags h1 &gttags Heading level 1 &lttags/h1 &gttags </div>
  <div> &lttags h3 &gttags Heading level 3 &lttags/h3 &gttags</div>
  <div> &lttags h4 &gttags Heading level 4 &lttags/h4 &gttags</div>
  <div> &lttags h5 &gttags Heading level 5 &lttags/h5 &gttags</div>
  <div> &lttags h6 &gttags Heading level 6 &lttags/h6 &gttags</div>

<dt>The effect are:</dt>
<br>
<dd>
  <h2>Heading Level 1</h2>

  <h3>Heading Level 2</h3>
  <hr>
  <h4>Heading Level 3</h4>
  <h4>Heading Level 4 </h4>
